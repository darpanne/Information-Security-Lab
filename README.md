# Information-Security-Lab

## Objective
The **Information Security Lab** provides a hands-on environment to explore and understand the principles of securing information systems. It focuses on offensive and defensive security techniques, enhancing your ability to analyze and mitigate potential threats in various scenarios.

## Skills Learned
- Designing and analyzing attack trees to understand threat structures.
- Implementing encryption techniques for data protection.
- Configuring and enforcing access control mechanisms.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities using tools like NetBus to understand attack surfaces.
- Performing steganography to hide and retrieve sensitive information.
- Cracking passwords, including LM and NTLM hashes, to test system defenses.
- Deploying and analyzing backdoors and trojans using Felix.
- Covering tracks using techniques such as Alternate Data Streams (ADS).

## Tools Used
- **Attack Tree Creation**: For structured threat modeling.
- **Encryption Tools**: For securing data communication and storage.
- **Access Control Utilities**: To configure user permissions and roles.
- **NetBus**: For remote administration and exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows 7.
- **Invisible Secret**: For performing steganography operations.
- **Hash Cracking Tools**: For cracking LM and NTLM password hashes.
- **Felix Trojan**: For deploying and understanding backdoor attacks.
- **Alternate Data Streams (ADS)**: For hiding files and covering tracks.
